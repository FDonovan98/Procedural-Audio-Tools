## Contracts

### Contract - 1, Sound Effect Generation, James Berry

You are currently been tasked with creating a tool which will generate sound
effects, these should consist of sequences of tone as well as sample manipulations. The sound effect should be clearly tied to an action the player makes in the game (e.g., picking up an item, attacking, walking over a trap, or so on).
An element of procedurality is expected to vary the tones.
 

### Contract - 4, Ambient Platformers Audio Generation ,Harry Donovan

You need to develop a tool to generate audio for the user interface. Theseshould be short tones to feed back to the player that they are successfullynavigating the user interface and configuring the gameâ€™s settings. This shouldbe somewhat consistent across the interface,  but the tones and samplesshould be modified in a systematic way to indicate success or failure. A varietyof settings should be made available and configurable by a designer.
